Applying for PACE is a decision you definitely won¬¥t regret! The trip offered everything ‚Äì from breathtaking nature experiences to great city tours and nice social events.

It is worth going! Good organization. BC is beautiful in all aspects: People, food, culture, history, landscapes, animals. You have time to meet, to enjoy. Many laughs will arise that you will never forget. You know friends from other parts of the world and you will always carry them in your heart. **-Claudia**

PACE 2019 is the best experience of my life! This trip is full of amazing people, cities, views and culture. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better group, 6 strangers that since the first moment became such as good friends for life! Canadians are very nice people; everyone made us feel comfortable and welcome in their country and home! The culture is beautiful. This trip is full of incredible activities, so much so that for me it was like traveling a whole month! The committee has a perfect organization; we enjoyed so much! I felt in love with Whistler and Victoria; small cities but beautiful! Grouse Grind, Chief and Blackcomb mountain‚Ä¶ Outstanding! Most of the activities were first times for me so I was so excited. Do not hesitate and apply for this experience next time! Highly recommended by the #NapGuy **-David**

Are you wondering: ‚ÄúShould I visit Canada and British Columbia?‚Äù? Do not think too much about it, just do it, listen to Shia LaBeouf üòâ PACE 2019 for me was the best adventure of my life and milestone in self improvement. Before PACE I was not sure if I want to travel abroad. Now I can‚Äôt imagine my life without visiting other countries. Within only 10 days I met a lot of amazing people, from which I learned a lot. PACERS told me about their countries and hosts showed me different sides of British Columbia (they prepared plenty of activities!). Every day was intense and breathtaking! You will not regret taking part in PACE. It will be one of your great experience in your life. **-Pawe≈Ç**

Hello, I am Vittoria, from District 2031 (Italy). PACE experience was absolutely A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! You get the opportunity to spend 10 days with awesome people from all over the world. At the beginning they are perfect strangers but ‚Äì in the end ‚Äì they are amazing trip MATES and Rotaract siblings! PACE is more than an ‚Äúholiday‚Äù experience. (Actually, it is not a holiday at all !! you will discover it VERY SOON!) üòä PACE is about sharing and learning. Sharing past-experiences, present time, opinions and ideas. All this sharing is translated into learnings.I learnt what other Rotaract clubs do (and I will pick up some ideas), I learnt a lot about Canada‚Äôs traditions cultures and history. Most of all, I learn a bit more to be a global citizen! I cannot neither explain nor list all the activities we did. (the list will be too long!!). I just suggest you to jump into this experience! Wish you to enjoy, learn and share as much as possible! **-Vittoria**

PACE was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had and as a Rotaractor I feel very grateful and lucky for having been able to participate in this wonderful trip. I had a blast and learned a lot from other people I got to meet and share with. It‚Äôs unbelievable to see how complete strangers can become great friends and connect in such a short period of time. This trip made me love Canada and Canadians more than before and it taught me that I can do anything I put my mind to.  The organizers really put their heart into it and make sure that everyone is taken care of at all times. It definitely went above and beyond my expectations, the views were stunning, the food was good and all people making this happen were very fun and caring. I loved being hosted by rotarians and getting to spend time with them as well. I would recommend this trip over and over again! **-Vivi**

  <summary>Participant Comments</summary>

I just don‚Äôt have words to express how I felt during my stay in Canada and specially during PACE2018. The Canadian culture is overall the greatest culture I have met. People is kind, nice, lovely and very welcoming, they make you feel you are at home, and that is something priceless. PACE2018 for me was the perfect opportunity to fall in love with Canada and to make me feel more into the idea of moving over in my near future. There is so much to do in BC that you will not believe it. Do not hesitate to apply for this trip and get your self into one of the best experiences you will have in your life! Guys I love you all!! -**Absalon**

If you want to live one of the best experiences in your life, apply to this trip! You will make wonderful excursions, you will meet unique and special friends, you will have fun every single day and you will see the most beautiful landscapes in the world. This experience will change your life!! -**Edoardo**

The Pace edition 2018 was just amazing! A great group of 6 trippers completed by amazing organisers made those 10 days unforgettable! British Columbia is an amazing place that every person that called itself a tripper should see one day. A wonderful Pacific coast surrounded by beautiful trees and giant mountain where amazing and beautiful cities like Victoria, Vancouver or Whistler stand! This trip is not made for tourists but for adventurers from a cold lake in Whistler to the Mountain pikes of Grouse Grind and the Chief or from the little cute street of the capital Victoria to every corner of the gigantic Vancouver, there is no time to get bored! Thank to the different cultures present via the immigration in BC, I had the opportunity to travel the world via food. The difficulty and accessibility in the same time of physical activities were a perfect balance for everyone in research of adventures after some hard-working months back home. It is a trip to be done for every Rotaractor in the world that loves to have sensations and in need of discoveries! -**Lionel**

PACE is more than you would expect. However, you think PACE will be like ‚Äì scratch that. It will surprise you in so many ways. I loved everything about this trip ‚Äì the people, the activities, the food, the places we‚Äôve seen and everything that we have experienced together, as friends. I think PACE is a great example of what Rotaract is and goes to show how people that have never met can become instant friends and miss each other dearly after the trip ends. Be warned ‚Äì you will be heartbroken after this trip as you will miss having all those amazing people in your life, on a daily basis, once you are back home. I strongly feel that every Rotaractor should experience a trip like PACE ‚Äì it‚Äôs a one of a kind opportunity. -**Maria**

PACE offers so many amazing experiences which makes it impossible to choose just one favourite activity. There is something on the program for everyone. From physical activities to culture to ethnic food, you get a great insight of British Columbia‚Äôs beauty and multicultural identity. What makes it even better, is that you get to share all of with a bunch of wonderful people, that become friends for life. I‚Äôm grateful I got the opportunity to be part of PACE and can only recommend this trip! I wish this trip never ended and I could‚Äôve just stayed in Vancouver for good! <3 -**Marina**

PACE was the best 10 days of experience I ever had!! BC was so beautiful, the mountains, the sea, the woods, all together gives me the most beautiful country I ever have seen. I didn‚Äôt imagine that I would have a new family in 10 days. Maria, Abs, Lio, Marina, Eddie, and the best local Rotaract Guides, made the trip unforgettable. If you want to make new friends, learn about new culture, try new food, see a beautiful country, be active and have a lot of fun, then PACE is the perfect trip, it has it all!! Go for it! -**Michelle**

PACE Rocks! Best Trip EVER. BC is such a beautiful place with breathtaking nature, happy and kind people but mostly it‚Äôs such a multicultural environment. I had the chance to experience 10 days full of experiences, making new friends all along the way. Friends for live. Visiting Grandville and the craft beers tasting was really fun and educational. I have to thank everybody who made this experience possible, I have no words to express my gratitude. -**Amiel**

Sometimes in life you just happen to meet people. People that will fill your heart with joy and make your life richer. People that will bestow you a one in a lifetime experience and will be friends you will never want to leave again. This sometimes is PACE. You come for a trip and go with your memory full of adventures and your heart bursting with love. Love for the breathtaking landscapes of British Columbia. Love for the delicious Food and snacks and drinks you are presented with and most of all the love for the incredible people from all over the world you will meet there. When there is a perfect example of what Rotaract friendship means and what it can do, then you will be blow away by the hospitality you will experience on this trip.  From the Mountaintops of Whistler to the Port of Victoria and the woods of Vancouver and the steep ascent of the Grind and the Chief, I fell in love with the area and its inhabitants. I am so thankful that I was given the opportunity and the chance to find family so far from home. A place to where I always will come back again and feel welcome and a bunch of awesome people I will never forget in my lifetime. It is worth every last mile you travel for it. It is a hell of a ride!! Go make it one of yours as well. -**Christian**

PACE2017 was an unbelievably beautiful experience and I feel so grateful that I had the opportunity to be a part of it! It‚Äôs a great journey that combines amazing nature, beautiful cities, countless number of fun activities, food, culture, knowledge, doing good, Rotaract and Rotary, and above all, open and warm-hearted people. If these are things that you love, you should definitely apply because PACE is a unique way to experience the beautiful British Columbia in lovely company! One thing you need to know beforehand, though: Canada will steal your heart <3 -**Julia**

What ever you are doing instead of applying to PACE is a waste of your time. This was honestly the greatest travel experience of my life so far ‚Äì I have never had such a fun filled, jam packed amazing experience with such fantastic like-minded people. This is a wonderful example of how Rotary can take you places ‚Äì see you all at RI 2019! -**Lauren**

I‚Äôve always traveled a lot and thought I had seen and tried on most things by now. I was WRONG. PACE exceeded my expectations by far and I tried on so many things for the first time! Tandem cycling, hiking, dragon boating, kayaking, pubcrawling, bull riding, line dancing, prom, eating ramen, beaver tails and dim sum ‚Äì the list goes on and on and on. I would summarize PACE as one of the best, if not the very best experience possible within Rotaract. You truly get the whole package ‚Äì great guides, local Rotaractors and hosts, amazing food, even more amazing activities and memories for life. It‚Äôs just a win-win-win all the way through. If I can promise anything, it is that you WILL regret it if you don‚Äôt apply next year (if I could, I‚Äôd do it over and over again). Best trip ever! -**Maria**

I can confidently say PACE has been my best trip (so far). The picturesque mountains, the beautiful (but cold) Pacific Ocean and the acres of woodland as far as the eyes could see provided a beautiful natural backdrop to a week that went by faster than it began. From racing between transit lines, running on only 5 hours of sleep, trying new food, meeting new friends, powering the strenuous hikes after a long night out and keeping up with a hectic set schedule. It was truly unforgettable and I would not have had it any other way with any other group of beautiful humans. Christian (eins), Lauren (drie), Julia (nelja), Maria (fem) and Amiel (seis), all made the trip even more than it was. Our random public dance parties, group hugs, silly selfies, loud count offs and carpool karaoke‚Äôs definitely left its mark across British Columbia (BC). Topped with the amazing PACE organizers and guiding Rotaractors who made each day even more memorable, there is no better way to explore BC than through PACE, as you get the true Canadian experience. Trust me; this is one of those bucket list items you never knew you needed!!!

No words can describe how awesome this PACE Trip 2016 was. We had a chance to get know a different country and wonderful people at the same time that we experienced a lifetime of adventures, put together in 10 amazing days in the beautiful British Columbia!  Outstanding views, amazing meals, incredible activities that includes biking, hiking, cooking, ice skating, and collecting so many memories in Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond, Whistler, Victoria, and more! All of that while getting to know the others PACERS, learn about their cultures, getting to know the amazing committee that gave us an unforgettable and perfect roundtrip, the hosts that welcome us in their homes and the other Rotarys and Rotaracts that sponsor this trip and make this opportunity happen, just thank  you so much!  I‚Äôll never forget this experience and I recommend to every Rotaractor in the whole world!  I had the time of my life, and a piece of my heart will always be in Canada, and in Malaysia, Croatia, India, Australia and England!  <3  Love you all! -**Julyenne**

As a relatively new Rotaractor, I couldn‚Äôt have picked a better first round trip! It was a fantastic way to explore British Columbia, and more importantly make some new friends from around the world. Don‚Äôt hesitate in applying for PACE, I promise you, you won‚Äôt regret it! -**Kieran**

PACE ‚Äì best Rotaract roundtrip ever!! Beautiful nature, very kind enthusiastic friendly people, wonderful places, awesome food, amazing activities (even the hikes). Once in a lifetime experience. British Columbia was so much more of what I‚Äôve expected, stole a piece of my heart. Big thanks to the fantastic organizers, the hosts, the super crazy lovely awesome pacers (July, Melissa, Priyanka, Kieran, Martin) and all the Rotaractors and Rotarians involved. You did an amazing job and made this experience unforgettable! I really felt like home. A true example of what Rotaract and Rotary community is all about. Don‚Äôt think twice to apply! It‚Äôs a must-do! You wont regret it, promise! -**Lina**

PACE 2016 was such an amazing experience! We were welcomed into an amazing country of beautiful majestic mountains, glistening lakes and flowing rivers. There was so much to see and to do and to explore! Travelling across British Columbia we hiked, cycled and kayaked to the next hidden gem awaiting for us around every corner. Everyone we met was so friendly, fun and full of enthusiasm. The local Rotaractors and Rotarians ensured we had every need met and were well looked after. It was the perfect opportunity to meet some fantastic people around the globe, working to make the world a better place through international goodwill and boosting friendships. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this trip more highly than that I‚Äôd love to do it all again! -**Martin**

If you‚Äôre looking for a round trip that brings you to the non-touristy, only-locals-know-best places, foods, and things to do, then PACE is for you! For the past 10 days, I had great time experiencing British Columbia with five other International Rotaractors. All that beautiful weather, fun fun fun activities, delicious food, silly jokes, crazy dancing and laughter will forever etched in my memory. I‚Äôm truly honored to be part of this amazing experience. Two thumbs up !! BIG WET KISSES to the PACE organizers to have arranged such a wonderful trip!!! TERIMA KASIH!! -**Melissa**

If I had to choose one word to describe this experience, it would probably have to be coined. That is how amazing the PACE trip was and I do not have enough words to do justice to the experience!  This being my first international trip and my first Rotaract roundtrip, I consider myself very fortunate to have been selected for such a wonderful experience. The PACE trip is so brilliantly and intricately planned to give you the best insights into the magical and multifaceted province of British Columbia. Right from the warmest welcome in the country by Rotarians and Rotaractors, the mesmerizing landscapes, majestic mountains, unforgettable experiences, friendships to last for a lifetime, super exciting activities, best fellow PACE participants, the most amazing bunch of dynamic and committed Rotaractors, PACE covers it all. I lost track of how many times I was awestruck throughout the trip. It is incredible how you get to experience so many extraordinary things in such a short span of time which ultimately bring about so much change within you and teach you such valuable lessons. Throughout the trip these little but powerful incidents took place which managed to teach me so much about myself and life. What you take back from this trip are memories to last a lifetime and friendships that extend to every corner of the globe. Those 10 beautiful days were nothing less than a dream for me. Thanks to PACE, a part of me will always belong to Beautiful British Columbia. I‚Äôm glad I applied for this program and you should too ‚ò∫ -**Priyanka**

After going through 10 days of amazing fun, adventure and learning, I should say that I have been really lucky to have been chosen for the PACE 2015 program. Though I had seen pictures of Pacific Canada on the internet, this part of the world is really a piece of paradise on earth. The sheer beauty of the place is not to be missed. The meticulous planning of the organizers, the warmth of the hosts and the cheerfulness of the Rotarians, Rotaractors and participants ensured that there was never a dull moment. I am going to treasure the experiences from this trip all my life. -**Aditya**

PACE was one of the best trips in my life‚Ä¶if not the best. Beautiful hikes, picturesque landscapes, friendly and kind people, awesome food, amazing activities, great company. Canada and Vancouver are everything what I expected, and even more. Thanks for the organizers, who did and an amazing job, that sets an example for trips all around the world to follow. If I can give you one advice: don‚Äôt hesitate even a minute, just apply! -**√Årp√°d**

PACE is definitely a must-do for every Rotaractor! It is incredible how many things we had the opportunity to do and see in only 10 days. Everything was well-organized and people were welcoming, friendly and enthusiastic. It is not only a roundtrip but a full experience that allowed us to build some new relationships and get lots of new ideas for our clubs at home. If you have the opportunity to be one of the next PACERS, I only recommend you to follow the flow and trust the guides, without thinking too much about the schedule. Leave your doubts and fears at home. You definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed! (PS: Get ready to fall in love with British Columbia). -**Francesca**

PACE was a once in a lifetime trip without a doubt. I met some amazing people and feel like I really got to know Vancouver whilst seeing some other parts of beautiful Canada. There were so many things to see and do and great people to meet. I certainly won‚Äôt forget this trip or the people I made it with! -**Liz**

It‚Äôs just a big big WOW. Don‚Äôt expect anything, just apply! It will be better than what you could ever imagine. PACE is packed with fun activities, which can put you to your limit. You will see Vancouver area through the eyes of locals. I am so thankful for this experience about culture, willingness, involvement and service above self, enthusiasm and most important: friendship. The committee, participating local Rotaractors, Rotarians, friends and family of those involved are open-mined and provide you a home away from home. I left my heart in Vancouver. Thx PACE2015! -**Nadine**

What an amazing example of international networking within Rotaract. Starting with being warmly welcomed from the get-go, I got to meet an amazing group of locals and fellow PACE participants from around the world. We saw bears and lumberjacks, hiked mountains, had a BBQ with local Rotarians by a pristine Canadian blue lake, went for high tea in Victoria, cycled Stanley Park, tried poutine and beaver‚Äôs tail and so much more ‚Äì sound great doesn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt think about applying, just do it. Would reapply for next year if I could. -**Will**

PACE 2014 ‚Äì What an amazing trip! As it was my first time to visit Canada as well as taking part in a Rotaract trip there are no words to describe how thankful I am to have been chosen as a participant. I enjoyed every single day of the trip and definitely made friends for life! Thanks to the whole PACE team, all the guides, hosts and of course to the other PACERS (Lulu, Giorgia, Manu and Kohey) who affected this trip to become an unforgettable experience! I hope to see you all again in the near future!!! -**Anna**

Vancouver definitely stole a piece of my heart. PACE trip gave me the opportunity of living 10 days that I‚Äôll never forget in my life. I feel very lucky because I had the chance to discover the city in the best possible way: we were guided by an enthusiastic and committed group of great people, that everyday gave their best to show us Vancouver and the surroundings, entertain us, challenge our limits and build life lasting friendships. I loved hiking mountains, visiting the nearby cities of Victoria and Whistler, walking through the city and partying during the night. Each single member of the hosting club, Burnaby Rotaract, taught me a great lesson about willingness, enthusiasm and friendship. Among them I really felt home and I experienced what ‚Äúfellowship through service‚Äù really is. The value of this experience is something I will never be able to explain, but I wish all the people I love to try something like that in their life. -**Giorgia**

PACE gave me a lot of unforgettable experiences. I enjoyed every single activity and moment. I am very proud to be one of PACErs this year and to spend time with awesome Rotaractors in District 5040 and 4 other PACErs. 10 days passed so quickly and each day was full of joy and surprise. This trip is the best trip ever in my life. Thank you for all the Rotarians and Rotaractors in District 5040 to give me this wonderful opportunity. -**Kohey**

PACE has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life! Everyday was filled with great activities, great food and surprises here and there! Now Canada has a very special place in my heart and that is all thanks to the amazing Rotarians and Rotaractors behind this experience! It is an amazing cultural exchange activity and I wish many Rotaractors get the chance to live this and enjoy it as much as I did! -**Lulu**

If you are reading this, you might be interested in this trip, pleas apply for it, don‚Äôt hesitate, and then you will thank me! üôÇ It‚Äôs a huge opportunity to meet awesome people, to get to know a very nice and multicultural country! Before I went, I thought, after the trip I was gonna make 5 new friends (pacers) and now I can tell you that I have many more friends, cause Rotaractors there, are just wonderful people, very nice and friendly. All you have to do is submit and get ready, everything else is all set up for you to have a perfect trip. It‚Äôs on you to enjoy it. It‚Äôs a very good way of knowing Canada, during this trip you get to know Canada from the inside, from the point of view that you wouldn‚Äôt get as a tourist. Of course it‚Äôs a nice opportunity to share your culture and traditions as well. Last but not less important, I could say I have a new family there. Not much more to say, Just want to thanks once again, to the Rotary Clubs who made this trip possible, all the Rotaractors that made this trip the best of the trips and special thanks to my host family! I‚Äôll miss you all Pacers and Canadians! I‚Äôll be back someday! Waiting for you here in Argentina!!! please come visit me üôÇ -**Manu**

I arrived for the PACE not knowing what to expect and with little knowledge of the Bristish Columbia area. After 10 amazing days packed full of exciting activities, I left with memories and friendships that will last a lifetime. The trip was a great representation of the area and very well organized from start to finish. I can‚Äôt think of a better way to explore a new place and bond with Rotaractors from all over the world! A+ experience in my book. -**Cody**

PACE 2013 was fantastic! I don‚Äôt have enough words to describe how I was happy in those ten days! It was a full package of fun and friendship. I was not expecting to see everything that I saw and get to know a bunch of wonderful people! We have been to so many beautiful places like the Grouse Mountain, Victoria, Whistler, Richmond and much more! Everybody that I had the chance to meet just made me to feel more and more happy! It‚Äôs unbelievable how we can be connected to people in only 10 days; I felt that I knew everybody for years!  I can say without any doubts that it was one of the best trips that I have ever made! Thank you so much for the entire PACE team, hosts, PACERS (Cody, Magda, Megan and Zoe) and everybody else involved that made those 10 days so wonderful! -**Joglas**

PACE was worth the way from Beirut‚Ä¶ No time for Jet Lag! Just a full program of amazing activities at magnificent BC spots with wonderful fellows! It is indeed an opportunity to live the real cultural exchange and to come back with lots of fun memories.. Love! -**Magda**

PACE 2013 was one of the best weeks of my life. I meet incredible people both international and from Canada, had great food, saw some incredible scenery and generally got amped on Rotaract.  I walked away energised to keep spreading the Rotaract back in NZ especially the international opportunities that we are starting to learn about. You guys were awesome!!! Thank you for the most incredible time. -**Megan**

This trip reinforced everything I believed and felt about Rotaract and Rotary International. This experience has raised my expectations for any future trips and I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to experience Vancouver in a more fantastic way and meet so many wonderful people under just 10 days. -**Zoe**

PACE was the very best thing that happened to me in my ENTIRE life! There‚Äôs no better way to know about Canada‚Äôs politics, food, culture, drink, way of living, economics and places. All you heard about Canada? Forget it. It‚Äôs way better than what anyone is able to describe‚Ä¶The very best thing about this project is that you are by the first time in Canada, with other five people who you never knew and you have a bunch of local Rotaractors to show you around. In this edition there were accents from Russia, Honduras, Italy, Brazil, Taiwan, USA, German, Romania and more. I saw snow, learned to ride a bike, made friends, was invited to go to many other countries, visited amazing places. It was all inspiring. I learned to respect the differences and those differences, in a weird way, brought everybody closer. The stereotypes vanished and we were all a big family. PACE is adventure, knowledge, fellowship, kaua tu, beautiful sights, food, poetry, culture, history and most of all, a opportunity to have the best time of your life, as I did. After Canada I went to US and spend more twenty days traveling all around, from West to East and met a lot of other Rotaractors. Apply now and just wait for the answer. When you are selected it‚Äôs magical! -**Fred**

PACE was the best thing that could happen to me this year! It was unimaginable and so much better than anything I had expected. I was really curious about the other participants and the Canadian Rotaractors, and I must say everyone was just so kind and open and exited about Rotaract and the trip. It was wonderful to feel that spirit and be part of it. British Columbia is fantastic with its diverse and beautiful nature. Every place we visited (Kelowna, Vancouver, Whistler, Victoria, Richmond) was unique and it really gave me a well rounded picture of BC. I loved that one could see and do so many different places and things in only 10 days. I sometimes looked at the schedule and thought, oh my good how shall we manage to do all those things in one day?! And again and again I was so surprised that you could. I felt really energetic the whole week and I think that was because of the special spirit we had in our group, everyone was always in a good mood and excited about everything we did. I loved all the sports, the kayaking, the biking, the dragon boating, the hiking in Whistler, and of course, my favourite, the Grouse Grind!! It was fantastic! I just felt so good the whole day after that (also while doing it), it was amazing. It‚Äôs hard to put it in words, PACE was a fantastic experience and I met great people from all over the world who I miss a lot and who I hope to see again sometime! It‚Äôs one of those memories you will never forget and that have a special place in your heart. Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to be part of this wonderful experience. It gave me so much and I am really thankful for it. -**Juliane**

Having been part of PACE 2012 is something that makes me really proud. The trip convinced me again, that Rotaract is the perfect addition for young people. During PACE 2012 I experienced everything that means Rotaract to me: I found various new friends and the great thing is, they are from all over the world. I learned and experienced so many interesting things that it is still hard to put it into words or even thinking about how to summarize all these crazy activities. Apart from the nature, the cities and the outdoor activities the probably most impressing fact about BC and PACE 2012 was the attitude of the organizers: I‚Äôve never met so many open-minded, relaxed and well-organised people in one place and this is to my mind the most important impression of the trip. I really learned something about myself, thanks to all these wonderful people I‚Äôve met and I can only recommend to start to write your own application right now. -**Laura**

You are surrounded by 10-15 people pretty much all the time for 10 days, they are people you just met, you are tired and in a hurry all the time. However, you don‚Äôt need anything else but THAT‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt need to get your personal space or privacy you want to make the most of those 10 day because everyone is AMAZING‚Ä¶ Not to mention that everywhere you look around you see something worth transforming into a postcard! -**Mirela**

The best experience of my life. -**Stefania**

To discover the world and make new friend of different social and cultural backgrounds is a wonderful opportunity that only an organization like Rotaract can offer. This trip really put these points at their utmost‚Ä¶ Vancouver is a vibrant, international city and I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs been the city of my first trip to Canada. From the poor downtown area to the Asian night market and the wonderful Stanley Park, we got an unbiased view of the diversity this city has. Victoria and the Whistler ski resort were also a great addition to this motley experience. It‚Äôs the first time of my life I see whales in their natural environment. The organizing team was so committed and the international participants so motivated, that we became a tightly knit group that kept the good mood and the support to each other, no matter what with have to struggle on‚Ä¶ And we had occasions to! In fact, this trip was challenging for me in two ways. First, physically. To climb the 3 km, 2830 steps, Grouse Grind the first morning with my still 8 hours jetlag was already stimulating‚Ä¶. And rewarding, by its wonderful postcard view. But the many sports we did the following days: hiking, biking, dragon boating, ice skating, kayaking, laser shooting‚Ä¶ were really demanding for me. Second, socially. It was the first time for me to do public speeches in English, in front of these crowed Rotarians audiences. I was pretty worried. But finally they got thrilled by my presentation! I succeeded in these two challenges! Finally, this trip will last in my life as an unforgettable good experience. I discovered wonderful areas, made friends for life and succeeded in surpassing myself and becoming a better person. Thank you. -**Alexandre**

What can I say about Canada? Only good things! My own journey began in Toronto ‚Ä¶ I was afraid! But ‚Ä¶ everything went well! Good people! Happy and willing to help! After that, I met my friends in Richmond I was even happier ‚Ä¶ everyone with good will and the Rotaractor spirit alive! The trip is impressive: Starting with the application: all very planned and organized every step of the time, and always hearing your feedback on top of everything! Reception: The meeting at the airport was great! All waiting, no delays (except on my part ‚Ä¶) and hosting division already prepared. The trip itself: exciting‚Ä¶ every city I met was a new experience of beauty, architecture and nature‚Ä¶ I must say I fell in love with Richmond even rising rapidly. I loved Victoria from the heart, it was the cutest place! Vancouver: a modern city, people of sound mind and open heart! Anyway I loved everything!‚Ä¶But, incredible as a place is, we really are the experiences we have with others: My traveling companions: I love you all! I hope one day meet again somewhere in the world. Organizers of the event: Thank you for everything! What I liked best was one place in particular: Grouse Grind. I must be honest and admit it was a very big challenge. First I did not like it‚Ä¶ it was physically exhausting for me! But today, I look back and think: What a great lesson this mountain has given to me! Reaching the top is hard but possible, especially if you have someone to encourage you along (Thanks Chris!). Each step must be taken with care, and each step climbed should be celebrated. In the end, the feeling is worth it! It is pleasant! Anyway ‚Ä¶ My advice: go, and feel! The verb is felt: the pleasure of being in a beautiful place, the delicious taste of a Bubble Tea, the warmth of people who make a point of your presence and wish you well! I wish I can return soon‚Ä¶ Kisses from Brazil! -**Aline**

Having been selected to attend last year‚Äôs trip was one of the highlights of my 2011 year. The trip itself was wonderfully organized and the comforts and needs of the trippers remained at the fore throughout the entire experience. As per most Rotaract trips, the organizers were extremely hospitable, and no wonder ‚Äì Vancouver is one of the most hospitable places I‚Äôve ever been to. It didn‚Äôt take too long for me to feel at home‚Ä¶ The food on the trip was fantastic. My favourite was the fresh seafood and nothing could beat the delicious assortment found at the Asian night market we visited in Richmond. The trip showcased the true beauty of Canada‚Äôs west coast. From seaside fishing wharfs, all the way up to the Chief‚Äôs peak, we saw it all. My favourite part of the trip was spending time on the water: sea kayaking, being on the ferry to visit the Victoria Rotaract Club on Vancouver Island, and swimming in frigid mountain valley lakes. We spent a lot of time experiencing and learning about the traditional culture of the First Nations people who have been living in British Columbia for generations. Their culture is unique, and Salish art can be found everywhere in the region. Downtown Vancouver is a dynamic, beautiful city and abounds with old shops, contemporary cultural facilities and historic bus tours that were amazingly good fun! While it was somewhat unorthodox I‚Äôm sure for a Canadian to be selected for the trip, I was no less in awe of the experience than any other traveler. It was extremely humbling being in the presence of such wonderful Rotaractors who embodied the true spirit of Rotaract. Let them take you on the adventure of a lifetime ‚Äì but remember, bring your hiking shoes and ‚Äúmake lots of photos!‚Äù -**Graham**

Last year I have been chosen as a participant in ‚ÄúPacific Canada Experience with Rotaract‚Äù. For more than a week trip, I spent all the great time with them (participants and also officers) together. Almost all of the places which we visited is the most wonderful and interesting places, especially for you guys who like adventure so much (you will be challenged to finish all the high mountain in Vancouver)‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs not all the program about, you will taste some special foods, like poutine, visit some cultural places, like museum, and also doing other excited activities guys. I really really really recommend all of you to take this chance for visiting Vancouver (Canada) by joining this amazing trip dude. It will be one of your great experience in your life. -**Tommy**
