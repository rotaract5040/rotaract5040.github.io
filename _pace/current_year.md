### PACE 2023: August 22 – August 31

The Pacific Canada Experience (PACE) is a round trip experience hosted by Rotaract District 5040 aimed at fostering global ties and intercultural exchange. Six international rotaractors are chosen to take part in an authentic 10-day experience of Western Canada facilitated by rotaractors within the district.  
Participants can expect various activities and outings featuring a unique mix of nature, city, and eco-friendly living. Designed to cover several places of interest within the province of British Columbia (BC), Rotaract Districts 5040 and 5020,  preivious participants have kayaked around Vancouver,  hiked the Grouse Grind, explored the city of Victoria (our provincial capital), explored Whistler Village, volunteer with local rotaractors and so much more!

We hope you will join us for this exciting adventure into Pacific Canada’s beautiful landscape, cultural diversity, and active lifestyle.

### Physical Activity Advisory

British Columbia is known for its breathtaking outdoor landscape, as it is conveniently nestled between the mountains and ocean. To provide an authentic Pacific Canada experience with PACE, there are two planned hikes, which are physically challenging. All successful applicants must be generally healthy and fit, and ideally, exercise on a regular basis. The hikes will elevate heart rates, however, anyone from 5 years old to 80 years old can accomplish it with some fitness, water, hiking shoes or runners, a positive attitude, and perseverance.

Note: All successful participants are expected to participate in the scheduled activities to the best of their ability and communicate clearly ahead of time if they require an exception.

### The Pacific Canadian Province of British Columbia

The province of BC is located between the Coast Mountain Range and Pacific Ocean thus offers the perfect balance of city and nature. Home to Canada’s third largest metropolitan region (Metro Vancouver) there is an abundance of breathtaking natural scenery made of lush green forests, towering mountains and vivid sunsets over the horizon of a deep blue ocean. Since hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, Metro Vancouver has transformed into a vibrant centre with a buzzing nightlife.

Metro Vancouver is made up of 21 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation. The region is multicultural and caters to a diverse group of people. The city of Vancouver is the region’s largest urban centre and it has been highly ranked as one of the most livable cities worldwide time and time again . Often referred to as a “city of neighbourhoods“, Vancouver offers an array of ethnic commercial areas, each having their own distinct character and taste.
