I love exploring and finding new places to eat. I just graduated from UBC with a Sociology major. My interests include reading, writing and thinking about big life questions while staring at a wall.

Joined Rotaract many years ago to give back to the community and make some friends in the process, it became a second family for me. I work in marketing but I’m going back to school for a master’s degree in counselling psychology. In my spare time, I coach high school football at Vancouver College.

Hi everyone! I've been with Rotary since high school and am thrilled to work as co-DRR for our district this year. This community has never failed to provide me with laughter, friendship and endless opportunities to grow while serving my community. I'm also a UBC science student and love drawing in my free time!

Hey everyone! My name is Kamil, I'm a second year at UBC and I hope to major in Political Science and International Relations. I joined Rotaract last year but have been involved with Rotary for quite a few years through Interact and other stuff. The thing I love most about Rotaract is that it's a platform to meet super fun people who instantly become your friends but are also super passionate about making our communities the best they can be.
