    who_we_are: |
        We are a group of young professionals that care deeply about three things: 1) giving back to our communities, 2) building our professional networks, and 3) strengthening our friendships. As part of Rotary International, we leverage their network to support our three goals. We meet regularly to socialize, learn, network and organize volunteer/philanthropic projects. 

        **President**: Julia Halbert. Julia is the Executive Assistant for Early Music Vancouver. She has been a singer and performer for over ten years having performed across Canada and the US. She has appeared in multiple documentaries and theatre productions. Julia has always been an active member of her community and most recently was the Secretary for the Vancouver Young Professionals Club from 2020-2021. In her spare time Julia is on the beach, out for a run or watching the office for the 3rd time. 
 
        **Vice President**: Eric Peach. Eric is an inventor and engineer who likes to see and do cool & interesting things, and take care of the people he cares about. For fun he enjoys volunteering, teaching & mentoring, creating music, designing electronic circuits (especially ones with lots of LEDs), and various outdoor activities. His current work involves designing sensors that capture radar & radio signals to help ships, planes and satellites navigate more safely, while detecting & locating hostile or criminal ships which may be trying to hide.
