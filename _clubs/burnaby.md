    who_we_are: |
        This year, the club celebrated its 10th anniversary! It started in 2007 to provide a service club for Simon Fraser University students, Burnaby Rotaract has developed to consist of diverse members from students to young professionals from different parts of BC, Canada, and the world. 

        The Burnaby Rotaract Club is proud of the high caliber of its members who are passionately partaking projects and events throughout the year. Year-round projects include container loading with Rotary World Help and Community Dinner with the Burnaby Neighborhood House. In addition, the club spearheads the planning and execution of the PAcific Canadian Experience (PACE)  roundtrip in partnership with local Rotaract Clubs from District 5040 and 5020.

        The club does work hard….while having fun! In addition to projects, the club conducts several socials throughout the year including Christmas, burger fundraisers and comedy nights! The club’s success would not be possible were it not for the amiable members, companionship with other Rotaract clubs in the district and the sponsorship of its sponsoring Rotary clubs who are dedicated to attend and support the club’s events.
