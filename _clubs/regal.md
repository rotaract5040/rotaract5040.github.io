    who_we_are: |
        Regal Rotaract is a new innovative cause-based club formed in 2020. Just like how an ecosystem needs energy, mineral nutrients, water, oxygen, and living organisms to survive, Regal Rotaract focuses on the unique backgrounds, cultures and experiences of its members in order to look at issues facing our community and solutions from different perspectives. We are the first Rotaract club with no age limit; our members range from university age to, well, ages that would be rude to mention. We are also the first Rotaract club to not have a host club. 

        Regal Rotaract is a club of action and change. Our goal is to lift up our community while also lifting up our Rotary family. We initiated Leaders Connect, a mentorship program currently available to Rotary and Rotaract members within our District 5040. 

        **President**: Jocelyn Vissia
